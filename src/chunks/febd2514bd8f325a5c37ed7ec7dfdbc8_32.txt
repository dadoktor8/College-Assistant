164CHAPTER 6The universal workflow of machine learning
For most problems, there are existing templates you can start from. You’re not thefirst person to try to build a spam detector, a music recommendation engine, or animage classifier. Make sure you research prior art to identify the feature engineeringtechniques and model architectures that are most likely to perform well on your task. Note that it’s not always possible to achieve statistical power. If you can’t beat a sim-ple baseline after trying multiple reasonable architectures, it may be that the answerto the question you’re asking isn’t present in the input data. Remember that you’remaking two hypotheses:You hypothesize that your outputs can be predicted given your inputs.You hypothesize that the available data is sufficiently informative to learn therelationship between inputs and outputs.It may well be that these hypotheses are false, in which case you must go back to thedrawing board. 6.2.4 Scale up: Develop a model that overfitsOnce you’ve obtained a model that has statistical power, the question becomes, is yourmodel sufficiently powerful? Does it have enough layers and parameters to properlymodel the problem at hand? For instance, a logistic regression model has statisticalpower on MNIST but wouldn’t be sufficient to solve the problem well. Remember thatthe universal tension in machine learning is between optimization and generalization
