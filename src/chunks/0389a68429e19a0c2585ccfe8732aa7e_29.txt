 like "0", becauseit may create a discontinuity in the latent space formed by your features, mak-ing it harder for a model trained on it to generalize. Instead, consider replac-ing the missing value with the average or median value for the feature in thedataset. You could also train a model to predict the feature value given the val-ues of other features.Note that if you’re expecting missing categorial features in the test data, but the networkwas trained on data without any missing values, the network won’t have learned toignore missing values! In this situation, you should artificially generate training sampleswith missing entries: copy some training samples several times, and drop some of thecategorical features that you expect are likely to be missing in the test data. 6.2.2 Choose an evaluation protocolAs you learned in the previous chapter, the purpose of a model is to achieve general-ization, and every modeling decision you will make throughout the model develop-ment process will be guided by validation metrics that seek to measure generalizationperformance. The goal of your validation protocol is to accurately estimate what yourAssuming x is a 2D data matrix of shape (samples, features)
