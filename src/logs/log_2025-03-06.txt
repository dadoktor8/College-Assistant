2025-03-06 03:14:02,246 [INFO]: Model Response: Let's see. The user wants a concise and clear summary of a given text. The text is about Dostoyevsky, his famous works, and his contributions to literature. The user also specified that if it can't be summarized, return a specific message. So, I need to read the text carefully and extract the key points.
