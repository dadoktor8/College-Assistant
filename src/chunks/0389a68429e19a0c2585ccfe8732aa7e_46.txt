m-ples are the most likely to help improve performance.This concludes the universal workflow of machine learning—that’s a lot of things tokeep in mind. It takes time and experience to become an expert, but don’t worry,you’re already a lot wiser than you were a few chapters ago. You are now familiar withthe big picture—the entire spectrum of what machine learning projects entail. Whilemost of this book will focus on model development, you’re now aware that it’s onlyone part of the entire workflow. Always keep in mind the big picture!SummaryWhen you take on a new machine learning project, first define the problem athand:–U n d e r s t a n d  t h e  b r o a d e r  c o n t e x t  o f  w h a t  y o u ’ r e  s e t t i n g  o u t  t o  d o — w h a t ’ s  t h eend goal and what are the constraints?–C o l l e c t  a n d  a n n o t a t e  a  d a t a s e t ;  m a k e  s u r e  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  y o u r  d a t a  i n  d e p t h .–C h o o s e  h o w  y o u ’ l l  m e a s u r e  s u c c e s s  f o r  y o u r  p r o b l e m — w h a t  m e t r i c s  w i l l  y o umonitor on your validation data?Once you understand the problem and you have an appropriate dataset, developa model:–P r e p a r e  y o u r  d a t a
