success metric of choice (such as accuracy) will be on actual production data. The reli-ability of that process is critical to building a useful model. In chapter 5, we reviewed three common evaluation protocols:Maintaining a holdout validation set—This is the way to go when you have plentyof data.Doing K-fold cross-validation—This is the right choice when you have too few sam-ples for holdout validation to be reliable.Doing iterated K-fold validation—This is for performing highly accurate modelevaluation when little data is available.Pick one of these. In most cases, the first will work well enough. As you learned,though, always be mindful of the representativity of your validation set, and be carefulnot to have redundant samples between your training set and your validation set. 6.2.3 Beat a baselineAs you start working on the model itself, your initial goal is to achieve statistical power,as you saw in chapter 5: that is, to develop a small model that is capable of beating asimple baseline. At this stage, these are the three most important things you should focus on:Feature engineering—Filter out uninformative features (feature selection) and useyour knowledge of the problem to develop new features that are likely to be useful
