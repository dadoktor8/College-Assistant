 Keras (see figure 7.1):The Sequential model, the most approachable API—it’s basically a Python list. Assuch, it’s limited to simple stacks of layers.The Functional API, which focuses on graph-like model architectures. It rep-resents a nice mid-point between usability and flexibility, and as such, it’s themost commonly used model-building API.Model subclassing, a low-level option where you write everything yourself fromscratch. This is ideal if you want full control over every little thing. However, youwon’t get access to many built-in Keras features, and you will be more at risk ofmaking mistakes.Sequential API+ built-in layersFunctional API+ built-in layersFunctional API+ custom layers+ custom metrics+ custom losses+ ...Subclassing:write everythingyourself from scratchNovice users,simple modelsEngineers withstandard usecasesEngineers withniche use casesrequiring bespokesolutionsResearchersFigure 7.1 Progressive disclosure of complexity for model building
174CHAPTER 7Working with Keras: A deep dive7.2.1 The Sequential modelThe simplest way to build a Keras model is to use the Sequential model, which youalready know about.from tensorflow import keras from tensorflow.keras import layers model = keras.Sequential([    layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),    layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")])Note that it’s possible to build the same model incrementally via the add() method,which is similar to the append() method of a Python list.model = keras.Sequential()model.add(layers
