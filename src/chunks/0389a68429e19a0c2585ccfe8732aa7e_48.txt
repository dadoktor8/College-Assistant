172Working with Keras:A deep dive
You’ve now got some experience with Keras—you’re familiar with the Sequentialmodel, Dense l a y e r s ,  a n d  b u i l t - i n  A P I s  f o r  t r a i n i n g ,  e v a l u a t i o n ,  a n d  i n f e r e n c e —compile(), fit(), evaluate(), and predict(). You even learned in chapter 3 howto inherit from the Layer class to create custom layers, and how to use the Tensor-Flow GradientTape to implement a step-by-step training loop. In the coming chapters, we’ll dig into computer vision, timeseries forecast-ing, natural language processing, and generative deep learning. These complexapplications will require much more than a Sequential a r c h i t e c t u r e  a n d  t h edefault fit() loop. So let’s first turn you into a Keras expert! In this chapter,you’ll get a complete overview of the key ways to work with Keras APIs: everythingThis chapter coversCreating Keras models with the Sequential class, the Functional API, and model subclassingUsing built-in Keras training and evaluation loopsUsing Keras callbacks to customize trainingUsing TensorBoard to monitor training and evaluation metricsWriting training and evaluation loops from scratch
