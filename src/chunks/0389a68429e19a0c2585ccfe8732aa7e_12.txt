he models you would train onsuch data would merely encode these same biases into a black-box algorithm thatwould give them a thin veneer of legitimacy. In a largely tech-illiterate society likeours, “the AI algorithm said this person cannot be trusted” strangely appears to carrymore weight and objectivity than “John Smith said this person cannot be trusted,”despite the former being a learned approximation of the latter. Your model would belaundering and operationalizing at scale the worst aspects of human judgement, withnegative effects on the lives of real people.Technology is never neutral. If your work has any impact on the world, this impact hasa moral direction: technical choices are also ethical choices. Always be deliberateabout the values you want your work to support.

Why is your customer trying to solve this particular problem? What value willthey derive from the solution—how will your model be used, and how will it fit intoyour customer’s business processes? What kind of data is available, or could be col-lected? What kind of machine learning task can be mapped to the business problem?6.1.1 Frame the problemFraming a machine learning problem usually involves many detailed discussions withstakeholders
