173Different ways to build Keras modelsyou’re going to need to handle the advanced deep learning use cases you’ll encoun-ter next.7.1 A spectrum of workflowsThe design of the Keras API is guided by the principle of progressive disclosure of complex-ity: make it easy to get started, yet make it possible to handle high-complexity usecases, only requiring incremental learning at each step. Simple use cases should beeasy and approachable, and arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible: no mat-ter how niche and complex the thing you want to do, there should be a clear path toit. A path that builds upon the various things you’ve learned from simpler workflows.This means that you can grow from beginner to expert and still use the same tools—only in different ways. As such, there’s not a single “true” way of using Keras. Rather, Keras offers a spec-trum of workflows, from the very simple to the very flexible. There are different ways tobuild Keras models, and different ways to train them, answering different needs.Because all these workflows are based on shared APIs, such as Layer and Model, com-ponents from any workflow can be used in any other workflow—they can all talk toeach other. 7.2 Different ways to build Keras modelsThere are three APIs for building models in Keras (see figure 7.1):The Sequential model, the most approachable API—it’s basically a Python list. Assuch, it’s limited to simple stacks of layers
