 technical choicesyou make throughout the project. It should directly align with your higher-level goals,such as the business success of your customer. For balanced classification problems, where every class is equally likely, accuracyand the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, abbreviated as ROCAUC, are common metrics. For class-imbalanced problems, ranking problems, ormultilabel classification, you can use precision and recall, as well as a weighted form ofaccuracy or ROC AUC. And it isn’t uncommon to have to define your own custommetric by which to measure success. To get a sense of the diversity of machine learningsuccess metrics and how they relate to different problem domains, it’s helpful tobrowse the data science competitions on Kaggle (https:/ / kaggle.com); they showcase awide range of problems and evaluation metrics. 
161Develop a model6.2 Develop a modelOnce you know how you will measure your progress, you can get started with modeldevelopment. Most tutorials and research projects assume that this is the only step—skipping problem definition and dataset collection, which are assumed already done,and skipping model deployment and maintenance, which are assumed to be handledby someone else. In fact, model development is only one step in the machine learningworkflow, and if you ask me, it’s not the most difficult one. The hardest things inmachine learning are framing problems and collecting, annotating, and cleaningdata
