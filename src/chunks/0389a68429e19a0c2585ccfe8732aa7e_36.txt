To address this, youshould consider showing some examples of the failure modes o f  y o u r  m o d e l  ( f o rinstance, show what incorrectly classified samples look like, especially those for whichthe misclassification seems surprising). They might also expect human-level performance, especially for processes that werepreviously handled by people. Most machine learning models, because they are (imper-fectly) trained to approximate human-generated labels, do not nearly get there. Youshould clearly convey model performance expectations. Avoid using abstract statementslike “The model has 98% accuracy” (which most people mentally round up to 100%),and prefer talking, for instance, about false negative rates and false positive rates. Youcould say, “With these settings, the fraud detection model would have a 5% false nega-tive rate and a 2.5% false positive rate. Every day, an average of 200 valid transactionswould be flagged as fraudulent and sent for manual review, and an average of 14 fraudu-lent transactions would be missed. An average of 266 fraudulent transactions would becorrectly caught.” Clearly relate the model’s performance metrics to business goals
