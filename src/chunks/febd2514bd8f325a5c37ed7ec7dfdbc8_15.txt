156CHAPTER 6The universal workflow of machine learningWhat do existing solutions look like? Perhaps your customer already has ahandcrafted algorithm that handles spam filtering or credit card fraud detec-tion, with lots of nested if statements. Perhaps a human is currently in chargeof manually handling the process under consideration—monitoring the con-veyor belt at the cookie plant and manually removing the bad cookies, or craft-ing playlists of song recommendations to be sent out to users who liked aspecific artist. You should make sure you understand what systems are already inplace and how they work.Are there particular constraints you will need to deal with? For example, youcould find out that the app for which you’re building a spam detection system isstrictly end-to-end encrypted, so that the spam detection model will have to liveon the end user’s phone and must be trained on an external dataset. Perhapsthe cookie-filtering model has such latency constraints that it will need to runon an embedded device at the factory rather than on a remote server. Youshould understand the full context in which your work will fit.Once you’ve done your research, you should know what your inputs will be, what yourtargets will be, and what broad type of machine learning task the problem maps to
