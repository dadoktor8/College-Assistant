Do any clear pat-terns emerge?Are some samples missing values for some features? If so, you’ll need to dealwith this when you prepare the data (we’ll cover how to do this in the nextsection).If your task is a classification problem, print the number of instances of eachclass in your data. Are the classes roughly equally represented? If not, you willneed to account for this imbalance.Check for target leaking: the presence of features in your data that provide infor-mation about the targets and which may not be available in production. Ifyou’re training a model on medical records to predict whether someone will betreated for cancer in the future, and the records include the feature “this per-son has been diagnosed with cancer,” then your targets are being artificiallyleaked into your data. Always ask yourself, is every feature in your data some-thing that will be available in the same form in production?6.1.4 Choose a measure of successTo control something, you need to be able to observe it.
