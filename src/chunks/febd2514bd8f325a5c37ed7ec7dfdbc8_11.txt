ing is broadly structured in three parts:1Define the task—Understand the problem domain and the business logic under-lying what the customer asked for. Collect a dataset, understand what the datarepresents, and choose how you will measure success on the task.2Develop a model—Prepare your data so that it can be processed by a machinelearning model, select a model evaluation protocol and a simple baseline tobeat, train a first model that has generalization power and that can overfit, andthen regularize and tune your model until you achieve the best possible gener-alization performance.3Deploy the model—Present your work to stakeholders, ship the model to a webserver, a mobile app, a web page, or an embedded device, monitor the model’sNote on ethicsYou may sometimes be offered ethically dubious projects, such as “building an AIthat rates the trustworthiness of someone from a picture of their face.” First of all,the validity of the project is in doubt: it isn’t clear why trustworthiness would bereflected on someone’s face. Second, such a task opens the door to all kinds of eth-ical problems. Collecting a dataset for this task would amount to recording the biasesand prejudices of the people who label the pictures. The models you would train onsuch data would merely encode these same biases into a black-box algorithm thatwould give them a thin veneer of legitimacy
