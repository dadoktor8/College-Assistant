Before you start training mod-els, you should explore and visualize your data to gain insights about what makes itpredictive, which will inform feature engineering and screen for potential issues.If your data includes images or natural language text, take a look at a few sam-ples (and their labels) directly.If your data contains numerical features, it’s a good idea to plot the histogramof feature values to get a feel for the range of values taken and the frequency ofdifferent values.If your data includes location information, plot it on a map
