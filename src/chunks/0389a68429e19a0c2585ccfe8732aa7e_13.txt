e mapped to the business problem?6.1.1 Frame the problemFraming a machine learning problem usually involves many detailed discussions withstakeholders. Here are the questions that should be on the top of your mind:What will your input data be? What are you trying to predict? You can onlylearn to predict something if you have training data available: for example,you can only learn to classify the sentiment of movie reviews if you have bothmovie reviews and sentiment annotations available. As such, data availabilityis usually the limiting factor at this stage. In many cases, you will have toresort to collecting and annotating new datasets yourself (which we’ll coverin the next section).What type of machine learning task are you facing? Is it binary classification?Multiclass classification? Scalar regression? Vector regression? Multiclass, multi-label classification? Image segmentation? Ranking? Something else, like cluster-ing, generation, or reinforcement learning? In some cases, it may be thatmachine learning isn’t even the best way to make sense of the data, and youshould use something else, such as plain old-school statistical analysis.–T h e  p h o t o  s e a r c h  e n g i n e  p r o j e c t  i s  a  m u l t i c l a s s ,  m u l t i l a b e l  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n  t a s k .–T h e  s p a m  d e t e c t i o n  p r o j e c t  i s  a  b i n a r y  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n  t a s k
