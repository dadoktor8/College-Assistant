ne your research, you should know what your inputs will be, what yourtargets will be, and what broad type of machine learning task the problem maps to. Beaware of the hypotheses you’re making at this stage:You hypothesize that your targets can be predicted given your inputs.You hypothesize that the data that’s available (or that you will soon collect) issufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and targets.Until you have a working model, these are merely hypotheses, waiting to be validatedor invalidated. Not all problems can be solved with machine learning; just becauseyou’ve assembled examples of inputs X and targets Y doesn’t mean X contains enoughinformation to predict Y. For instance, if you’re trying to predict the movements of astock on the stock market given its recent price history, you’re unlikely to succeed,because price history doesn’t contain much predictive information. 6.1.2 Collect a datasetOnce you understand the nature of the task and you know what your inputs and tar-gets are going to be, it’s time for data collection—the most arduous, time-consuming,and costly part of most machine learning projects.The photo search engine project requires you to first select the set of labels youwant to classify—you settle on 10,000 common image categories. Then youneed to manually tag hundreds of thousands of your past user-uploaded imageswith labels from this set
