In this chapter, you’ll learn about a universal step-by-step blueprint that you canuse to approach and solve any machine learning problem, like those in the previouslist. This template will bring together and consolidate everything you’ve learned inchapters 4 and 5, and will give you the wider context that should anchor what you’lllearn in the next chapters. The universal workflow of machine learning is broadly structured in three parts:1Define the task—Understand the problem domain and the business logic under-lying what the customer asked for
