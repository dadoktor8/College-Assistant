model’s predictions to the new annotations. For instance, you shoulddefinitely do this for the image search engine and the bad-cookie flagging system.
170CHAPTER 6The universal workflow of machine learningWhen manual audits are impossible, consider alternative evaluation avenuessuch as user surveys (for example, in the case of the spam and offensive-contentflagging system). 6.3.4 Maintain your modelLastly, no model lasts forever. You’ve already learned about concept drift: over time, thecharacteristics of your production data will change, gradually degrading the perfor-mance and relevance of your model. The lifespan of your music recommender systemwill be counted in weeks. For the credit card fraud detection systems, it will be days. Acouple of years in the best case for the image search engine. As soon as your model has launched, you should be getting ready to train the nextgeneration that will replace it. As such,Watch out for changes in the production data. Are new features becoming avail-able? Should you expand or otherwise edit the label set?Keep collecting and annotating data, and keep improving your annotationpipeline over time. In particular, you should pay special attention to collectingsamples that seem to be difficult for your current model to classify—such sam-ples are the most likely to help improve performance.This concludes the universal workflow of machine learning—that’s a lot of things tokeep in mind
