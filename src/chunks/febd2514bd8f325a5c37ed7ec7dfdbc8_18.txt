l need to find exist-ing satellite images taken in different weather conditions. To get a good model,you’re going to need thousands of different sites.You learned in chapter 5 that a model’s ability to generalize comes almost entirelyfrom the properties of the data it is trained on—the number of data points you have,the reliability of your labels, the quality of your features. A good dataset is an asset wor-thy of care and investment. If you get an extra 50 hours to spend on a project, chancesare that the most effective way to allocate them is to collect more data rather thansearch for incremental modeling improvements. The point that data matters more than algorithms was most famously made in a2009 paper by Google researchers titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”(the title is a riff on the well-known 1960 article “The Unreasonable Effectiveness ofMathematics in the Natural Sciences” by Eugene Wigner). This was before deep learn-ing was popular, but, remarkably, the rise of deep learning has only made the impor-tance of data greater.

Sometimes, annotations can be retrievedautomatically, such as those for the music recommendation task or the click-through-rate prediction task
